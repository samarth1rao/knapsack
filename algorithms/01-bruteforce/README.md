# Brute Force Approach

Here, we present the most basic, brute force approach to the problem.  
The brute force approach works by:  
1. Calculate the value of every possible combination of items in the knapsack.
2. Discard the combinations that are heavier than the knapsack weight limit.
3. Choose the combination of items with the highest total value.
